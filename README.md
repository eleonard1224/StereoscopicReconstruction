# Stereoscopic Reconstruction 
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, `Stereo.ipynb`, which takes in a video of a simulated, spinning wind turbine created in Blender and outputs a reconstruction of this video using stereoscopic imaging and OpenCV.  The videos in the notebook don't seem to appear when previewed in GitHub, but they can be accessed as files from within the repository.  `WindTurbine1.mp4` is a video of the spinning wind turbine generated in Blender and `WindTurbine.mp4` is a video of the reconstruction of the turbine motion as generated by OpenCV.
